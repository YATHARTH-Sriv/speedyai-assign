The different ways to understand the userbase of Streamify<br>
## Key Metrics:<br>
5 cards comprising of different types of data.<br>
Did Some changes to the card component to have arguments and use the same card component without making new file for each card<br>

## Data Visulaisation: Graphs indicating different types of data metrics<br>
1. Bar Chart for the active users and the corresponding month<br>
2. Pie Chart to understand different streams of revenue and the revenue achieved<br>
3. Line Chart for the top 5 streamed songs<br>

## Data Table:  
Containing Song Name,Artist,	Date Streamed,	Stream Count and	User ID<br>
Also the sorting and filtering logic for date streamed and stream count also filter by name of artist and song<br>

Tried using same components with different data for optimization and to decrease the load time<br>
